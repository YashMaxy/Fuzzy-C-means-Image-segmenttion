# Fuzzy-C-means-Image-segmenttion in PyTorch
An **unsupervised** approch for segmentation of images using **Fuzzy** based clustering in **PyTorch**. It Also support **GPU** computation for faster perfformance.  

This folder contains unsupervised model/algorithms to perform images segmentation and masking on Digital bacilleria(@Devoworm).
